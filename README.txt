This repository contains the instruction file as well as the final core genome results for analyzing 150 fasta files from Vibrio parahaemolyticus isolate Whole Genome Sequencing. WGS was performed by UNH on Vp sampled from the Great Bay Estuary, and genomes were generated in order to compare sequence types isolated from two sampling methods: water filtration versus water enrichment. Maria Valadez Ingersoll (Boston University) designed the bioinformatic pipeline outlined here to annotate the genomes (using Prokka), determine species present in each genome and degree of contamination of the genomes (kraken2 and acdc), and determine the core and accessory genomes. Only 78 core genes were discovered using this pipeline, at least partially due to the high degree of contamination (as observed with kraken2).
