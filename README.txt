This repository contains the instruction file as well as the final core genome results for analyzing 150 fasta files from Vibrio parahaemolyticus isolate Whole Genome Sequencing. WGS was performed by UNH on Vp sampled from the Great Bay Estuary, and genomes were generated in order to compare sequence types isolated from two sampling methods: water filtration versus water enrichment. Briefly, to explore the genetic diversity of V. parahaemolyticus isolated using each method, 150 whole genomes were sequenced using Illumina 250 paired end sequencing and quality assembled using the a5 pipeline. Genome annotation and pangenome analyses were performed as previously described. All genomes were individually annotated with Prokka, then acdc and kraken2 were used to identify and remove contaminating sequences. Samples in which less than 90% of the resulting sequence corresponded to Vibrio or for which the genome file was too small for thorough analysis (less than 3 mb) were discarded, and outlier strains detected from split network analyses were removed. The resulting 119 cleaned sequences were re-annotated with Prokka using the built-in Vibrio database. Finally, roary was performed on all the isolates from both method subgroups combined, and then separately on each subgroup. Core genes were defined as genes that are shared among >=99% of all strains in the group. Soft core, shell, and cloud genes were defined as genes present in the ranges of 95-99%, 15-95%, and 0-15% of strains respectively, and the total genes were defined as the number of all unique genes detected in each group.  Core genes identified in enrichment and filtration subgroups were then compared in Rstudio (v.4.4.1) using the VennDiagram package (v.1.7.3). 

Maria Valadez Ingersoll (Boston University) designed the bioinformatic pipeline outlined here to annotate the genomes, determine species present in each genome and degree of contamination of the genomes (kraken2 and acdc), and determine the core and accessory genomes.
